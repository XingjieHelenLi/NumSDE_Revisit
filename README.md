# NumSDE_Revisit
This repository includes codes for all numerical examples.

Figure 1, Figure 3 and Figure 4 are created by 'NumSDE_benchmak_codes.ipynb'

Figure 2 is created by 'moment_evolution_Err.m'

Figure 5 is created by 'plot_porus_coeff.m' and 'stationary_density_reflecting.m'

Figure 6 is created by 'SDE_nonlinear_erf.m', the numerical test for the nonlinear example: with case = 1 for small eta and case =2 for large eta;

Figure 7 is also created by 'SDE_nonlinear_erf.m', with setting dt_array = [0.01, 1] only.

The mathematica file is used to compute the analytical expression for evolution of first and second moments from time grid n to time grid n+1.
